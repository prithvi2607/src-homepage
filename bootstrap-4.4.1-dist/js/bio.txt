During this pandemic several rumors are being spread due which so many people have developed myths about it. some of them are as follows with proper reasoning: 
MYTH 1: EATING GARLIC OR LEMON (AND OTHER FOODS COMMONLY USED AS HOME REMEDIES FOR FLU AND COMMON COLD) CAN HELP PREVENT INFECTION WITH THE NEW CORONAVIRUS.
False. Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties. Similarly, vitamin C is an essential nutrient that can support immune function. However, there is no evidence from the current outbreak that eating garlic or lemon (or other foods for that matter) has protected people from the new coronavirus.
MYTH 2: SPRAYING ALCOHOL OR CHLORINE ALL OVER YOUR BODY CAN KILL THE NEW CORONAVIRUS.
False. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under appropriate recommendations.
MYTH 3: THE NEW CORONAVIRUS CANNOT BE TRANSMITTED IN AREAS WITH HOT AND HUMID CLIMATES.
False. The COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather.
